Over the last couple of weeks I've been trying to creature projects using my own libraries, and I've come to the conclusion that I'm not happy with the way Meltrix is designed. When I was first thinking about creating this library, I jumped straight into coding with verry little thought about design and usage. Due to this, it feels clunky in design and it missed out on core features that I've thought of whilst already implementing other stuff.

**Worry not!** Although this attempt at meltrix is now archived, I am working on a new version of the library that will be much more user-friendly and feature-rich. I will be taking my time to design the library properly and to make sure that it is easy to use and extend. I will keep this version up as a reminder for myself that coding without designing is setting yourself up for failure.
